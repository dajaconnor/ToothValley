Terrain Attributes:

- Soil Density - 0-63
	worse for vegetation
	better for manmade features
	lower water saturation (flood's easier) - saturation = moisture/(64 - density)
	prevents erosion

- Saturation - 

> Evaporation
	For every hex of saturation over 100%, move one moisture from ground to air.

- Moisture - 0-63

- MoistureInAir - 0-15
	humidity = MoistureInAir/(elevation/4)
	if humidity > 100% || (humidity > 75% && adjacent hex rains) - rain
	
- wind/blow
	Pick random hex, move all MoistureInAir to adjacent hex with least MoistureInAir which moves to adjacent hex.  
	Use black list so moisture doesn't move back.  Pick more hexes until length of black list is 75% of all hexes.
	
> Rain
	Dump all moisture from air to ground if humidity > 100% || (humidity > 75% && adjacent hex rains).

- Elevation - 0-63
	determines direction of flood, movement difficulty and precipitation
	
> Flood - for all hexes, if not already flooded, flood, then flood all hexes flooded to.
	if saturation>100% and saturation>adjacent hex and elevation local > elevation adjacent
	Erodes

> Grow
	if saturation within growth boundaries for adjacent vegetation && adjacent vegetation is greater than 
	local vegetation && enough ground moisture available && picked to grow by random grow function
	
- Adjacent Vegetation - The highest form of vegetation able to grow on current hex that exists on local hex 
						or on an adjacent hex
	
> Erode
	If flood from local hex to adjacent hex, get random erosion level (0- and density + rootStrength < maximum density
	density ++ for local, density -- for adjacent
	
> Burn
	Random hex, random time, start fire.  Fire deletes all plants on hex (set to null)  Fire strength = total moisture

Map Attributes:

- wraps both x and y
- non-buildable zone as border (so if map is expanded, buildings and roads aren't mangled)

- Vegetation

	rootStrength -
		- grants resistance to standing water
		- increases soil stability
		- limits growth by density

	maxSaturation -
		- reduces rot
		
	moistureRequired -
		- limits growth by moisture
		- determines fire resistance and fire strength
		- determines plant hierarchy
		
		

	form order: [jungle,forest,thicket,grass,null]
	prevents erosion
	holds water apart from moisture index
	releases all moisture to atmosphere if destroyed or replaced
	This requires objects of their own
	Moisture displacement determines plant heirarchy.  Grass can only propogate grass, 
		thicket can propogate grass or thicker, etc.
	
	- jungle
		rootStrength = 16
		Requires: saturation<120%
